</h1>


- üì± <b>Productivity</b>. Every trade offer you receive is forwarded to you in Telegram
- üõ°Ô∏è <b>Safety</b>. Application doesn't inject anything in Path of Exile, thus you won't be banned
- üèÉ <b>Flexibility</b>. You can reply to every trade offer via Telegram messenger just by replying to received message!
  

## Why

In Path of Exile, the absence of an auction-like mechanism complicates the trading system. It requires players to constantly monitor trade offers while being near their PC.

This application addresses a key issue: when players are away from their PC, such as browsing TikTok on the couch, they can receive whisper messages from PoE directly to their Telegram account. 

This means a player can instantly view incoming trade offers without needing to return to their PC. Additionally, players can respond to these whispers directly through Telegram Messenger. This feature is particularly useful for avoiding interruptions, like being pulled away from TikTok for a low-value trade offer (every PoE player will agree that being distracted by 1c trading is an unproductive activity).

#### How it works

Application constantly observes log file of Path of Exile located in `Path of Exile/logs/Client.txt`. If there is Whisper message, it instantly forwards to Telegram Channel. 

To get replies to messages in the Telegram Channel, application constantly polls Telegram API for getting updates of a bot.
